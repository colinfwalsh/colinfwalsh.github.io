# Getting Started with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a fantastic free service that allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. Whether you're building a personal portfolio, a project documentation site, or a blog like this one, GitHub Pages makes deployment simple and straightforward.

## What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. It's perfect for:

- Personal portfolios
- Project documentation
- Blogs (like this one!)
- Landing pages
- Online resumes

## Setting Up Your First GitHub Pages Site

### Step 1: Create a Repository

First, you'll need a GitHub account. Once you have that:

1. Click the **New** button to create a new repository
2. Name your repository `[username].github.io` for a user site, or any name for a project site
3. Make sure it's set to **Public**
4. Initialize with a README (optional)

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

Navigate to your repository's **Settings** tab:

```bash
Settings → Pages → Source → Deploy from a branch
```

Select your branch (usually `main` or `master`) and the folder (root or `/docs`).

### Step 3: Add Your Content

Create an `index.html` file in your repository:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My GitHub Pages Site</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my GitHub Pages site.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 4: Push and Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

Your site will be available at:
- User site: `https://[username].github.io`
- Project site: `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]`

## Advanced Features

### Custom Domains

You can use your own domain name with GitHub Pages:

1. Add a `CNAME` file to your repository with your domain
2. Configure your domain's DNS settings
3. Enable HTTPS in your repository settings

### Jekyll Integration

GitHub Pages has built-in support for Jekyll, a static site generator:

```yaml
# _config.yml
theme: minima
title: My Awesome Blog
description: A blog about web development
```

### Automatic Deployments

Every push to your designated branch automatically triggers a new deployment. You can track deployment status in the Actions tab.
